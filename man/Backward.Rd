\arguments{
\item{bck}{\code{kalisBackwardTable} as returned by \code{\link{MakeBackwardTable}}}

\item{pars}{a \code{kalisParameters} object returned by \code{Parameters}}

\item{t}{a locus position to move the forward table to.  Must be lessless than or equal to the current locus, \code{bck$l}.}

\item{nthreads}{the number of CPU cores to use}

\description{
Propagates a \code{kalisBackwardTable} to an upstream locus position (nothing is returned: the table is updated in-place).
}
\details{
Backward implements the backward algorithm to advance the rescaled HMM backward probabilities stored in
a \code{kalisBackwardTable} \code{bck} to a new target locus \code{t}.  Note that \code{t} must be less than or equal to the current locus, \code{bck$l}.

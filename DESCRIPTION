Description: kalis provides a high performance implementation of the Li &
  Stephens model <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704198> for local
  ancestry inference (local referring to a region of the genome).  For a set of
  N phased haplotypes, kalis computes the posterior marginal probability of each
  haplotype copying every other haplotype by running N hidden Markov models in
  parallel.  This yields an N x N distance matrix that summarizes the recent local
  ancestry at each locus of interest.  The package provides functionality for
  specifying a recombination map, site-specific mutation rates, and differing
  prior copying probabilities for each recipient haplotype.  Extensive use is 
  made of low level threading and CPU vector instructions.
